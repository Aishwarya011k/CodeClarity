# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a **harassment-free, inclusive, and respectful experience** for everyone.

We commit to:
- Welcoming diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.
- Promoting empathy, collaboration, and constructive discussions.
- Ensuring the OSCI 2025 community is a safe and supportive space.

## Our Standards

### Positive behaviors include:
- Using respectful and inclusive language.
- Actively listening to others and valuing different perspectives.
- Providing constructive feedback with kindness and clarity.
- Owning up to mistakes and apologizing when necessary.
- Prioritizing community well-being over individual preferences.

### Unacceptable behaviors include:
- Disrespectful, discriminatory, or offensive comments.
- Trolling, personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Sharing others’ personal information without consent.
- Persistent disruptive behavior in discussions or events.

## Respectful Communication Guidelines
To maintain a positive community culture, we ask all members to:
1. **Be clear and constructive** – phrase feedback to help others grow.
2. **Assume good intent** – misunderstandings happen; clarify before reacting.
3. **Disagree respectfully** – critique ideas, not people.
4. **Keep discussions inclusive** – avoid jargon or exclusionary language when possible.
5. **Pause before posting** – ensure your words contribute positively.

1. **Document the incident** (time, place, people involved, and description).
2. **Report privately** by emailing: **osci2025-report@community.org**.
3. Reports will be reviewed confidentially and fairly by the OSCI 2025 community leadership.
4. The reporter’s privacy and safety will always be respected.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take corrective action when necessary. They may remove or edit contributions, and in severe cases, issue warnings, temporary bans, or permanent bans.

## Enforcement Guidelines
The community will follow these steps for violations:
1. **Correction** – Private notice with explanation.
2. **Warning** – Formal warning with conditions.
3. **Temporary Ban** – Removal from community spaces for a period.
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent exclusion for repeated or severe violations.
