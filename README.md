An AI-powered platform that explains, debugs, and visualizes code with interactive flowcharts, 3D models, and voice narration.

---

## 💡 Full Project Vision

Build an intelligent AI-powered web platform that accepts both pasted code snippets and uploaded text/code files in multiple programming languages including C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and generates detailed, easy-to-understand code explanations.

The platform supports multiple comprehension levels (e.g., for 10-year-olds or 20-year-olds), making it accessible to all kinds of learners. It visualizes logic and flow with animated flowcharts, 3D models for arrays/matrices/trees/graphs, and includes a “Why?” mode for line-by-line explanations.

It can:
- Fix buggy code and explain the mistake.
- Narrate code in natural voice.
- Analyze complexity (time & space).
- Execute code step-by-step in a sandbox.
- Track code evolution over time.
- Suggest smart optimizations with side-by-side comparisons.
- Auto-generate quizzes, test cases, and summary files.
