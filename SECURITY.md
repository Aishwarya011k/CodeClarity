🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing them.

If you discover a vulnerability in CodeClarity:

Do not open a public issue or pull request.

Instead, contact us directly via email:
📧 damacharlasushma@gmail.com
👤 GitHub: @Sushma-1706

Provide as much detail as possible:

Steps to reproduce

Impact assessment (e.g., data exposure, privilege escalation, sandbox escape, XSS, etc.)

Environment details (browser, OS, version)

Suggested remediation (if available)

⏱️ We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution (typically within 7–14 days depending on severity).

🤝 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To keep our community safe, we request that security researchers:

Allow sufficient time for investigation and patching before public disclosure

Avoid actions that compromise user data or service availability

Do not attempt to exploit, exfiltrate, or retain sensitive information

Follow coordinated disclosure — you report privately, we fix, then we publish together

Researchers who adhere to responsible disclosure will be publicly credited in our release notes. 🌟

🛡️ Security Practices in CodeClarity

We follow strict security hygiene to minimize risks:

Sandboxed Execution → All user code runs in an isolated environment to prevent local/system access.

Dependency Monitoring → Regular audits with npm audit, dependabot, and security patches applied promptly.

Secure Input Handling → Validation & sanitization to protect against XSS, SQLi, command injection.

Secrets Management → No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in source code.

HTTPS by Default → All network communication is encrypted.

Principle of Least Privilege → Minimal permissions for services and APIs.

CI/CD Security Checks → Automated linting, vulnerability scans, and integrity checks before deployments.

🧪 Security Testing

We encourage contributors to run:

npm audit
npm run lint


before opening a PR, and flag any suspicious dependencies or vulnerabilities.

🏆 Recognition

Researchers and contributors who report security issues responsibly will be recognized in the Acknowledgments section of release notes.

For significant contributions, we may provide early access to new features as a token of appreciation.

🙏 Acknowledgments

We thank the open-source community and ethical security researchers for helping us keep CodeClarity safe, reliable, and trustworthy for everyone. 💜
